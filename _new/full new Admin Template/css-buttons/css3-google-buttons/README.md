# Overview #

Because I'm a fan of the new Google UI seen in Gmail, Docs, Calendar, etc, I decided to reproduce
the look of these new UI elements for my own personal use.

## Browser compatibility ##

This is being tested in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox only. I have
no immediate plans to test this in IE.

## Acknowledgements ##

The foundation of the CSS was borrowed heavily from the 
[css3-github-buttons](https://github.com/todc/css3-github-buttons) project.
And of course, Google.
